    <p>Matches elements based on keywords or patterns that are passed into the selector as an argument. In it&rsquo;s simplest form it matches elements based on the <strong>even</strong> or <strong>odd</strong> keywords, returning all odd or even numbered targeted elements. If a single value is passed into the selector that specific element is returned if it exists. For example the selector <strong>li:nth-child(3)</strong> would match the third list item in a list. It gets a little more complicated when you consider the pattern matching formula of <strong>(an + b)</strong>, where <strong>a</strong> is the number to match, <strong>n</strong> represents a repeating pattern, and <strong>b</strong> is a starting offset. The value <strong>(3n)</strong> would match every third item, starting from the third item and continuing (so 3, 6, 9, and so on). The value <strong>(3n + 2)</strong> would match every third item, <em>starting</em> with the second item (so 2, 5, 8, and so on). Some values are redundant,<strong> (2n + 2)</strong> would be the same as <strong>(2n)</strong>, for example. Negative values can be used for both <strong>a </strong>and <strong>b</strong> values, and can allow you to count backwards, but a match will be returned only if they result in a positive value. The value <strong>(-2n + 10)</strong> would start at 10 and count backwards by two, returning the 10th, 8th, 6th, 4th, and 2nd elements.</p>
    <p>There are four variations to nth-child selectors; <strong>nth-child(n)</strong>, <strong>nth-last-child(n)</strong>, <strong>nth-of-type(n)</strong>, and <strong>nth-last-of-type(n)</strong>.</p>
    <h3>Syntax</h3>
    <p>As a pseudo-class selector, nth-child selectors start with a colon (<strong>:</strong>), followed by the appropriate selector (<strong>nth-child</strong>), which is followed by a parentheses containing either a keyword (<strong>even</strong> or <strong>odd</strong>) or a <strong>pattern matching formula</strong>.</p>
